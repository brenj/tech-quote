Item Catalog
============

About
-----
From Udacity:
> You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a
> variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and
> authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post,
> edit, and delete their own items.

Supporting courses:

* [Full Stack Foundations](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088)
* [Authentication & Authorization: OAuth](https://www.udacity.com/course/authentication-authorization-oauth--ud330)

Tech Quote (TQ) hosts technology-related quotes, specifically quotes relating
to programming languages. The TQ application meets all requirements for
the [Item Catalog](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) 
project by implementing the following:

* JSON API endpoint at `quote/api/v1/quotes`
```javascript
// quote/api/v1/quotes payload example
{
	"quotes": [{
		"author": {
			"bio": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/2705542/tim-peters",
			"name": "Tim Peters"
		},
		"category": {
			"description": "Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.",

-------------

All configuration is accomplished by environmental variables.
The following variables are available:

*APP_SETTINGS* 
- Configuration object to be used to run application.

*DATABASE_URI*
- Database connection string to connect to application database.

*GITHUB_ID*
- OAuth2 client id provided by GitHub for access to API.

*GITHUB_SECRET*
- OAuth2 client secret provided by GitHub for access to API.

*TQ_SECRET*
- A byte string which is the master key by which all form values are encoded.
  Set to a sufficiently long string of characters that is difficult to
  guess or bruteforce (recommended at least 16 characters) for example
  the output of os.urandom(16).
